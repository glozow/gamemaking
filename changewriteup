# Change! Adjustable! Writeup

## New Feature: Adjustable Width and Height.

### Game-Specific Menu
Upon opening the game-specific menu, there are two new options:
* (W)idth to change the width of the board. Width is also the number of pieces for each player.
* (H)eight to change the height of the board.
The MaxWidth is 4 and MaxHeight is 3 right now because the database gets too big if you go further.
As soon as you select a new width or height, the default board is created for that board size and set as the initial position.

### Print Functions
The print position function is also now able to print boards of any width or height or position.

### Under The Hood
The board representation is still an array of BlankOX's, but imagine a matrix with HEIGHT+2 row and WIDTH+1 columns.


### Further Recommendations
Right now, the number of positions is 3^BOARDSIZE*2 which is extremely space-inefficient.
